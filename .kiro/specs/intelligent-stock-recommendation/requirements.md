# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This system is an intelligent stock trading recommendation system designed specifically for individual investors who read common market reports and analysis reports but lack actionable guidance on future price movements and optimal selling points. Unlike traditional market reports that provide general analysis, this system addresses the critical gap by offering concrete stock recommendations with future price projections and evidence-based investment rationale. The system targets individual investors considering medium to long-term investments (6 months to 1 year or more) who want to make investment decisions based on past price movements, company IR information, and historical patterns of similar companies.
